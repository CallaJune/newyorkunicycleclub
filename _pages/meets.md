The regular meetings of the New York Unicycle Club take place at Grant's Tomb on the first Sunday and third Saturday of each month, from noon until dark. 

## Grant's Tomb

Grant's Tomb is located in Manhattan's Upper West Side in quiet Morningside Heights.  Located on Riverside Drive and nestled in the northern end of Riverside Park, Grant's Tomb is surrounded by trees, playgrounds, and quiet streets. There is a beautiful view of the Hudson River to the west, and Riverside Church and The Cathedral of St. John The Divine to the east.  A few blocks to the south is Columbia University.

There is ample free parking and nearby rest rooms.  Good food is a short unicycle ride away.  Or you can just wait for the ice cream truck to arrive.  There is a large open area in front of the tomb, which has a great riding surface and is never crowded. 

Getting there is easy.  By subway, take the 1 to 116th Street.  Ride your unicycle north to 122nd Street and turn left.  When you get to Riverside Drive, Grant's Tomb will be in front of you.  If you take the IRT express trains 2 or 3 from midtown, be sure to transfer to the 1 at 96th Street.  By bus, take the M-104, M-4 or M-5 to 120th or 122nd Street.  By car, take the Henry Hudson Parkway (9A) to exit 11 (95th/96th Street) or exit 12 (125th Street). Go east and take Riverside Drive to 122nd Street.  Ample street parking is available on Riverside Drive at Grant's Tomb.  The tomb is between the northbound and southbound lanes of Riverside Drive.  You can circle Grant's Tomb on Riverside Drive.
